The modern approach to modular arithmetic was developed by Carl Friedrich Gauss in his book \"Disquisitiones Arithmeticae\" published in 1801.\n- **Congruence Modulo \\( n \\):** Two numbers \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are said to be congruent modulo \\( n \\) if their difference \\( a - b \\) is an integer multiple of \\( n \\).

This is not true; they only need to differ by a multiple of \\( n \\).\n- Another misconception is that the modulus must be a prime number. While prime moduli are often used in problems, any positive integer can be a modulus.\n\n**Additional Theoretical Insights:**\n- The Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) is a significant result in number theory that deals with solving systems of simultaneous congruences with different moduli. It states that if one knows the remainders of the division of an integer \\( n \\) by several integers, then one can determine uniquely the remainder of the division of \\( n \\) by the product of these integers, under the condition that the divisors are pairwise coprime.\n<\/knowledge_base_end>\n<solution_start>\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of moves Sergey needs to identify the number \\( N \\) that Xenia thought of.

These numbers are pairwise coprime. Therefore, we can use the CRT to find a unique solution for \\( N \\) modulo \\( K = 1 \\times 2 \\times 3 \\times \\ldots \\times 20 = 5000! \\).\n\n### Step 4: Determining the Number of Moves\nTo determine \\( N \\) uniquely, we need to know the values of \\( a_k \\) for all \\( k \\) from 1 to 20. Since \\( a_k \\) is the remainder when \\( N \\) is divided by \\( k \\), and \\( N \\equiv a_k \\pmod{k} \\), we need to know all 20 values \\( a_k \\).\n\nThus, Sergey needs to make 20 moves to determine \\( N \\) uniquely.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of moves Sergey needs to determine for sure the number Xenia thought of is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

A subcollection is tight if the union of its subsets is a proper subset of \\( X \\) and no element of \\( X \\) lies in exactly one of the subsets.\n\n### Step 2: Key Observations\n1. **Proper Subset Condition**: The union of any subset in the collection must be a proper subset of \\( X \\).\n2. **No Tight Subcollection**: No subcollection of the subsets should be tight.\n\n### Step 3: Constructing the Collection\nTo ensure that no subcollection is tight, we need to avoid having any element of \\( X \\) that lies in exactly one subset. This means that for any element \\( x \\in X \\), it must be in at least two subsets in our collection.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Subsets\n1. **Total Subsets**: The total number of non-empty subsets of \\( X \\) is \\( 2^n - 1 \\).\n2. **Avoiding Tight Subcollections**: To avoid having a tight subcollection, we need to ensure that no element is in exactly one subset.

This implies that \\( f \\) must be zero for any configuration of \\( 2n \\) points that satisfies these conditions.\n\n2. **Symmetry and Polynomial Degree:**\n   The polynomial \\( f \\) must be invariant under permutations of the points. This means that if we permute the points, the polynomial remains unchanged.\n\n3. **Regular \\( 2n \\)-Gon:**\n   For a regular \\( 2n \\)-gon, the points are equally spaced on a circle.

To satisfy this, \\( f \\) must be a polynomial in the elementary symmetric functions of the coordinates.\n\n6. **Elementary Symmetric Functions:**\n   The elementary symmetric functions of the coordinates \\( (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \\ldots, (x_{2n}, y_{2n}) \\) are:\n   \\[\n   e_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{2n} x_i, \\quad e_2 = \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq 2n} x_i x_j, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad e_{2n} = x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_{2n}\n   \\]\n   and similarly for \\( y \\)-coordinates.\n\n7. **Degree Calculation:**\n   The polynomial \\( f \\) must be a function of these symmetric functions.

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic states that every integer greater than 1 either is a prime number itself or can be represented as the product of prime numbers and that this representation is unique.\n\nWhen dealing with equations involving factorials and primes, it's important to understand the properties of factorials and primes.

This means a knight can attack up to 8 different positions from its current position.\n\n2. **Placing Knights:**\n   To ensure that knights do not attack each other, we need to place them in such a way that no two knights can attack each other. This is a classic problem in combinatorial game theory.\n\n3. **Checkerboard Pattern:**\n   One effective strategy is to use a checkerboard pattern. By alternating the color of the squares (black and white), we can place knights on the black squares without them attacking each other. This is because knights move to squares of the opposite color.\n\n4. **Checkerboard Pattern on a 20x20 Board:**\n   - A 20x20 board has 20 rows and 20 columns.\n   - If we color the board with a checkerboard pattern, each row and each column will have an equal number of black and white squares.\n   - Specifically, each row and each column will have 10 black squares and 10 white squares.\n\n5. **Placing Knights on Black Squares:**\n   - Since each row and each column has 10 black squares, Horst can place a knight on each of these black squares.\n   - This means Horst can place knights on 10 black squares in each row, resulting in a total of \\( 10 \\times 20 = 200 \\) knights.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - By using the checkerboard pattern, Horst can place knights on the black squares without them attacking each other.\n   - This strategy ensures that Horst can place at least \\( 200 \\) knights on the board.\n\nTherefore, the maximal positive \\( K \\) such that, regardless of the strategy of Queenie, Horst can put at least \\( K \\) knights on the board is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{200}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

This implies that the maximum sum we can consider is \\(n\\).\n\n3. **Forming Pairs**:\n   - To ensure the sums are different and do not exceed \\(n\\), we can pair the smallest and largest elements repeatedly.\n   - For example, if we pair \\((1, n)\\), \\((2, n-1)\\), and so on, the sums will be \\(1 + n\\), \\(2 + (n-1)\\), and so on.\n\n4. **Counting the Pairs**:\n   - We can form pairs \\((i, n+1-i)\\) for \\(i\\) ranging from 1 to \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\).\n   - This gives us \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\) pairs.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - The sums of these pairs are \\(i + (n + 1 - i) = n + 1\\), which is greater than \\(n\\) and does not fit our requirement.\n   - Therefore, we need to adjust our approach to ensure the sums are different and do not exceed \\(n\\).\n\n6. **Correct Approach**:\n   - We can pair elements such that the sums are different and do not exceed \\(n\\).\n   - For example, if \\(n = 5\\), we can pair \\((1, 5)\\), \\((2, 4)\\), and \\((3, 3)\\) (but 3 is used twice, so we need to adjust).\n\n7. **Final Pairing Strategy**:\n   - Pair \\((1, n)\\), \\((2, n-1)\\), and so on, ensuring the sums are different and do not exceed \\(n\\).\n   - This can be done by pairing \\((i, n+1-i)\\) for \\(i\\) from 1 to \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor - 1\\) and possibly one more pair if \\(n\\) is even.\n\n8. **Counting the Pairs**:\n   - For \\(n\\) even, we can form \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\) pairs.\n   - For \\(n\\) odd, we can form \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\) pairs.\n\n9. **Final Answer**:\n   - The maximum number of disjoint pairs is \\(\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor\\).\n\nThus, the maximum number of disjoint pairs of elements from the set \\(\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}\\) such that the sums of the different pairs are different integers not exceeding \\(n\\) is \\(\\boxed{\\left\\lfloor \\frac{n}{2} \\right\\rfloor}\\).\n<\/solution_end>"}

By the given condition, no two points lie on this line.\n   - For a triangle to be fat, the origin must be inside the triangle, and thus, the line through the origin cannot be a line through any pair of points in the triangle.\n\n6. **Counting Fat Triangles:**\n   - We need to count the number of triangles where the origin is strictly inside.\n   - For each point \\( A \\) in the set, consider the line through the origin and \\( A \\). The points on the opposite side of this line (excluding \\( A \\)) can form triangles with \\( A \\) that are fat.\n\n7. **Maximizing the Number of Fat Triangles:**\n   - For each point \\( A \\), the number of points on the opposite side of the line through the origin and \\( A \\) is at most 2020 (since no three points lie on a line).\n   - However, we need to ensure that the origin is strictly inside the triangle.\n\n8. **Final Calculation:**\n   - The maximum number of fat triangles can be derived by considering the combinatorial constraints and the geometric properties of the points.\n   - By carefully analyzing the problem, we find that the maximum number of fat triangles is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2019}\n\\]\n\nThis result is derived by considering the combinatorial constraints and the geometric properties of the points in the plane.\n<\/solution_end>"}

The possible values for \\(a\\) are:\n- \\(a = 1\\), then \\(b = 2 \\times 1 = 2\\)\n- \\(a = 2\\), then \\(b = 2 \\times 2 = 4\\)\n- \\(a = 3\\), then \\(b = 2 \\times 3 = 6\\)\n- \\(a = 4\\), then \\(b = 2 \\times 4 = 8\\)\n\n### Step 7: Form the Numbers and Identify the Largest\nThe possible numbers are:\n- \\(10a + b = 10 \\times 1 + 2 = 12\\)\n- \\(10a + b = 10 \\times 2 + 4 = 24\\)\n- \\(10a + b = 10 \\times 3 + 6 = 36\\)\n- \\(10a + b = 10 \\times 4 + 8 = 48\\)\n\nThe largest number among these is 48.\n\n### Step 8: Verify the Solution\nLet's verify that reversing the digits of 48 results in a number that is 75% greater than 48:\n- Reversed number: 84\n- 75% of 48: \\(0.75 \\times 48 = 36\\)\n- 48 + 36 = 84\n\nThus, the reversed number 84 is indeed 75% greater than 48.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe largest two-digit number that becomes 75% greater when its digits are reversed is \\(\\boxed{48}\\).\n<\/solution_end>"}

Each plane must contain at least one point from \\(S\\) and none of the planes can pass through the origin.\n\n6. **Constructing the Planes:**\n   We can construct the planes by considering the following:\n   - Each plane must contain at least one point from each coordinate direction (i.e., each plane must intersect the grid in a way that ensures it contains points from \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) directions).\n   - We need to ensure that no plane passes through the origin.\n\n7. **Minimum Number of Planes:**\n   By carefully constructing the planes, we can ensure that each plane intersects the grid in a way that meets the constraints.

The constraints are:\n- \\( 1 \\leq a \\leq 9 \\) (since \\( n \\) is a three-digit number)\n- \\( 0 \\leq b, c \\leq 9 \\)\n- \\( a + b + c = 24 \\)\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Feasibility of the Sum\nSince \\( a \\) must be at least 1 and at most 9, we need to check if it is possible to achieve the sum of 24 with \\( a \\) in this range.\n\n- If \\( a = 9 \\), then \\( b + c = 24 - 9 = 15 \\). The maximum value for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) each is 9, so this is not possible.\n- If \\( a = 8 \\), then \\( b + c = 24 - 8 = 16 \\). The maximum value for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) each is 9, so this is not possible.\n- If \\( a = 7 \\), then \\( b + c = 24 - 7 = 17 \\). The maximum value for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) each is 9, so this is not possible.\n- If \\( a = 6 \\), then \\( b + c = 24 - 6 = 18 \\). The maximum value for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) each is 9, so this is not possible.\n- If \\( a = 5 \\), then \\( b + c = 24 - 5 = 19 \\). The maximum value for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) each is 9, so this is not possible.\n- If \\( a = 4 \\), then \\( b + c = 24 - 4 = 20 \\). The maximum value for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) each is 9, so this is not possible.\n- If \\( a = 3 \\), then \\( b + c = 24 - 3 = 21 \\). The maximum value for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) each is 9, so this is not possible.\n- If \\( a = 2 \\), then \\( b + c = 24 - 2 = 22 \\). The maximum value for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) each is 9, so this is not possible.\n- If \\( a = 1 \\), then \\( b + c = 24 - 1 = 23 \\). The maximum value for \\( b \\) and \\( c \\) each is 9, so this is not possible.\n\n### Step 3: Check for Valid Combinations\nSince none of the values for \\( a \\) from 1 to 9 allow \\( b + c \\) to sum to 24, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's consider the possibility of using negative digits or exceeding the digit range.\n\n### Step 4: Re-evaluate the Problem\nGiven the constraints, it is clear that the sum of the digits of a three-digit number cannot be 24. Therefore, there are no valid combinations that satisfy the condition \\( a + b + c = 24 \\) within the given digit ranges.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Probability\nSince there are no valid combinations, the number of favorable outcomes is 0. The total number of possible outcomes is the number of three-digit integers, which is 900 (from 100 to 999).\n\nThus, the probability is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{sum of digits} = 24) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \\frac{0}{900} = 0\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

A common divisor of two numbers is any integer that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. The greatest common divisor (GCD) is the largest of these common divisors. For two numbers to have exactly two positive common divisors, one must be 1 (the only positive integer that divides all integers) and the other must be the GCD of the two numbers. This typically occurs when the numbers are relatively prime (i.e., their GCD is 1) but not prime themselves.\n\nA key formula in number theory is the Euclidean algorithm, which is used to find the GCD of two numbers. The algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The process involves repeated division and taking remainders until the remainder is zero.\n\nCommon pitfalls include misunderstanding the relationship between the GCD and the number of common divisors, and not recognizing when two numbers are relatively prime.\n\nAdditional theoretical insights include the fact that the number of common divisors of two numbers is directly related to their GCD.

It is calculated as the change in the y-coordinates divided by the change in the x-coordinates between any two points on the line. For a line passing through points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), the slope \\(m\\) is given by:\n\\[ m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \\]\n\nIn a square, all sides are of equal length, and each angle is a right angle (90 degrees). The diagonals of a square are equal in length and intersect at right angles (90 degrees). The slope of a diagonal in a square can be used to determine the slopes of the sides it connects.\n\nCommon pitfalls include confusing the direction of the slope (whether it is positive or negative) and miscalculating the change in coordinates.

This ensures that the sum \\( g(1) + g(2) + \\cdots + g(20) \\) is minimized while satisfying the tenuous condition.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - For \\( x, y \\leq 14 \\):\n     \\[\n     g(x) + g(y) = x + y > x^2\n     \\]\n     This is true because \\( x + y \\geq x + x = 2x \\) and \\( 2x > x^2 \\) for \\( x \\leq 14 \\).\n   - For \\( x \\leq 14 \\) and \\( y > 14 \\):\n     \\[\n     g(x) + g(y) = x + (y + 1) = x + y + 1 > x^2\n     \\]\n     This is true because \\( x + y + 1 \\geq x + 15 > x^2 \\) for \\( x \\leq 14 \\).\n   - For \\( x, y > 14 \\):\n     \\[\n     g(x) + g(y) = (x + 1) + (y + 1) = x + y + 2 > x^2\n     \\]\n     This is true because \\( x + y + 2 \\geq x + 16 > x^2 \\) for \\( x \\geq 15 \\).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   The function \\( g(x) = x \\) for \\( x \\leq 14 \\) and \\( g(x) = x + 1 \\) for \\( x > 14 \\) satisfies the tenuous condition and minimizes the sum \\( g(1) + g(2) + \\cdots + g(20) \\).\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible value for \\( g(14) \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

This involves applying combinatorial principles to determine the number of dishes that can be uniquely paired with each resident without repetition.\n\nCommon pitfalls in such problems include overlooking the requirement for unique pairs and miscalculating the number of possible combinations.

In a full town, every pair of dishes is known by exactly one resident. The goal is to find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length 6.\n\n### Step 2: Counting the Number of Residents\nIn a full town with 8 dishes, each resident knows how to make exactly 2 dishes. Therefore, the total number of residents is:\n\\[\n\\frac{8 \\times 7}{2} = 28\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Constructing the Graph\nWe can represent the residents and the dishes as a bipartite graph \\( G \\) where:\n- The vertices on one side represent the residents.\n- The vertices on the other side represent the dishes.\n- There is an edge between a resident and a dish if the resident knows how to make that dish.\n\nSince the town is full, each dish is connected to exactly 2 residents, and each resident knows exactly 2 dishes.\n\n### Step 4: Finding Cycles\nWe need to find cycles of length 6 in this graph. A cycle of length 6 means a sequence of 6 residents where each resident knows how to make a dish that the next resident knows.\n\n### Step 5: Counting the Cycles\nTo count the number of such cycles, we can use the following approach:\n1. **Choose 6 residents out of 28**: The number of ways to choose 6 residents from 28 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{28}{6}\n\\]\n2. **Arrange the residents in a cycle**: For each set of 6 residents, there are \\( 6! \\) ways to arrange them in a cycle.\n\nHowever, since the cycles are indistinguishable by rotation and reflection, we need to divide by the number of ways to permute the cycle (which is \\( 6 \\times 2 = 12 \\)) and the number of ways to reflect the cycle (which is 2):\n\\[\n\\frac{6!}{12} = \\frac{720}{12} = 60\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Combining the Results\nThe total number of distinguishable cycles is:\n\\[\n\\binom{28}{6} \\times 60\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Calculating the Final Result\n\\[\n\\binom{28}{6} = \\frac{28!}{6!(28-6)!} = \\frac{28!}{6! \\cdot 22!}\n\\]\n\nUsing a calculator or software to compute this:\n\\[\n\\binom{28}{6} = 376740\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of distinguishable cycles is:\n\\[\n376740 \\times 60 = 22604400\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{22604400}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

That is, $\\left|\\operatorname{dish}\\left(\\mathcal{F}_{d}\\right)\\right|=d$.\n\nIn order to avoid the embarrassing situation where two people bring the same dish to a group dinner, if two people know how to make a common dish, they are forbidden from participating in the same group meeting. Formally, a group assignment on $T$ is a function $f: T \\rightarrow\\{1,2, \\ldots, k\\}$, satisfying the condition that if $f\\left(r_{i}\\right)=f\\left(r_{j}\\right)$ for $i \\neq j$, then $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}$ do not know any of the same recipes. The group number of a town $T$, denoted $\\operatorname{gr}(T)$, is the least positive integer $k$ for which there exists a group assignment on $T$.\n\nFor example, consider once again the town of ARMLton. A valid group assignment would be $f($ Paul $)=f($ Kelly $)=1$ and $f($ Arnold $)=2$. The function which gives the value 1 to each resident of ARMLton is not a group assignment, because Paul and Arnold must be assigned to different groups.\n\n\nFor a dish $D$, a resident is called a $D$-chef if he or she knows how to make the dish $D$. Define $\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)$ to be the set of residents in $T$ who are $D$-chefs. For example, in ARMLville, David is a steak-chef and a pancakes-chef. Further, $\\operatorname{chef}_{\\text {ARMLville }}($ steak $)=\\{$ Sally, David $\\}$.\n\n\nIf $\\operatorname{gr}(T)=\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for some $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called homogeneous. If $\\operatorname{gr}(T)>\\left|\\operatorname{chef}_{T}(D)\\right|$ for each dish $D \\in \\operatorname{dish}(T)$, then $T$ is called heterogeneous. For example, ARMLton is homogeneous, because $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLton $)=2$ and exactly two chefs make pie, but ARMLville is heterogeneous, because even though each dish is only cooked by two chefs, $\\operatorname{gr}($ ARMLville $)=3$.\n\n\nA resident cycle is a sequence of distinct residents $r_{1}, \\ldots, r_{n}$ such that for each $1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$, the residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{i+1}$ know how to make a common dish, residents $r_{n}$ and $r_{1}$ know how to make a common dish, and no other pair of residents $r_{i}$ and $r_{j}, 1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$ know how to make a common dish. Two resident cycles are indistinguishable if they contain the same residents (in any order), and distinguishable otherwise. For example, if $r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4}$ is a resident cycle, then $r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}, r_{3}$ and $r_{3}, r_{2}, r_{1}, r_{4}$ are indistinguishable resident cycles.\nIn terms of $k$ and $d$, find the number of distinguishable resident cycles of length $k$ in $\\mathcal{F}_{d}$.","category":"math","gt":["$\\frac{d !}{2 k(d-k) !}$"],"answer":"<knowledge_base_start>\nIn combinatorial mathematics, particularly in the study of group theory and graph theory, problems often involve counting the number of ways to arrange or select elements under certain constraints.

We will use a combinatorial approach to show that there are only finitely many such integers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Understanding \\( n \\)-Colourful Definition:**\n   An integer \\( m \\geq n+1 \\) is \\( n \\)-colourful if, given infinitely many marbles in each of \\( n \\) colours \\( C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n \\), it is possible to place \\( m \\) marbles around a circle such that in any group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles, there is at least one marble of each of the \\( n \\) colours.\n\n2. **Key Insight:**\n   We need to find the largest \\( m \\) such that \\( m \\) is not \\( n \\)-colourful. This means that there exists a group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles where no marble of every \\( n \\) different colours appears.\n\n3. **Using the Pigeonhole Principle:**\n   If \\( m \\) is not \\( n \\)-colourful, then there must be a group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles where at least one colour is missing. This is because if every group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles had at least one marble of each of the \\( n \\) colours, then \\( m \\) would be \\( n \\)-colourful.\n\n4. **Counting the Missing Coloured Marbles:**\n   In any arrangement of \\( m \\) marbles, there are \\( m \\) marbles and \\( n \\) different colours. If \\( m \\) is not \\( n \\)-colourful, there must be a group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles where at least one colour is missing. This implies that the number of marbles of any single colour in any group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles is at most \\( n \\).\n\n5. **Bounding the Number of Missing Coloured Marbles:**\n   Since there are \\( m \\) marbles and \\( n \\) different colours, and each group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles can have at most \\( n \\) marbles of any single colour, the number of marbles of any single colour in the entire arrangement is at most \\( n \\times \\left\\lfloor \\frac{m}{n+1} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\n6. **Ensuring a Group of \\( n+1 \\) Consecutive Marbles:**\n   To ensure that at least one group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles has no marble of a particular colour, we need to consider the total number of marbles of any single colour. If we have more than \\( n \\) marbles of any single colour, then it is impossible to avoid having a group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles with no marble of that particular colour.\n\n7. **Finding the Largest Non-\\( n \\)-Colourful Integer \\( m \\):**\n   The largest \\( m \\) that is not \\( n \\)-colourful can be found by considering the number of marbles of any single colour. If \\( m \\) is too large, we can always find a group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles with no marble of a particular colour. By increasing \\( m \\), we eventually reach a point where this condition is unavoidable.\n\n8. **Final Calculation:**\n   The largest \\( m \\) that is not \\( n \\)-colourful is given by:\n   \\[\n   m = n^2 + 1\n   \\]\n   This is because for \\( m = n^2 + 1 \\), we can always find a group of \\( n+1 \\) consecutive marbles with no marble of a particular colour, making it not \\( n \\)-colourful.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThus, the largest positive integer that is not \\( n \\)-colourful is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{n^2 + 1}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

For example, if \\( r_1 = (1, 2, \\ldots, 100) \\) and \\( r_2 = (2, 3, \\ldots, 101) \\), then \\( |T(r_1, c) - T(r_2, c)| \\geqslant 2 \\) for all \\( c \\).\n   - This construction can be extended to more rows by ensuring that each new row differs from all previous rows in at least one column by at least 2.\n\n5. **Counting the Maximum Number of Rows:**\n   - Each new row must differ from all previous rows in at least one column by at least 2.\n   - If we have \\( N \\) rows, we can ensure that each new row differs from the previous row in at least one column by at least 2.\n   - This means that each new row can be constructed by shifting the previous row by at least 1 position.\n\n6. **Deriving the Formula:**\n   - If we start with one row and ensure that each new row differs from the previous row in at least one column by at least 2, we can have at most \\( 100 \\) rows.\n   - This is because each row must be a permutation of the numbers 1, 2, ..., 100, and we can have at most \\( 100 \\) such permutations.\n\n7. **Conclusion:**\n   - The largest \\( N \\) for which there exists such a table is \\( 100 \\).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{100}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

In the context of this problem, a palindrome is a 15-letter sequence where the first 7 letters determine the entire sequence.\n- **Combinatorics**: The branch of mathematics dealing with the study of finite or countable discrete structures, particularly in counting and arranging objects.\n\n### General Relevant Formulas and Equations\n- **Counting Principle**: If there are \\( n \\) ways to do one thing, and \\( m \\) ways to do another, then there are \\( n \\times m \\) ways to do both.\n- **Permutations and Combinations**: These are fundamental concepts in combinatorics used to count the number of ways to arrange or select objects.\n\n### Common Pitfalls and Misconceptions\n- **Overcounting**: A common error in combinatorics problems where certain arrangements are counted more than once.\n- **Misunderstanding the Symmetry of Palindromes**: Not recognizing that the first half of a palindrome determines the second half can lead to complex and unnecessary calculations.\n\n### Additional Theoretical Insights\n- **Symmetry in Palindromes**: The symmetry property of palindromes simplifies the problem by reducing the number of independent choices needed to form a palindrome.\n- **Constraints in Combinatorics**: When dealing with constraints (like having four consecutive letters spelling out \"ARM L\"), it's crucial to account for these constraints in the counting process.\n<\/knowledge_base_end>\n<solution_start>\nTo solve the problem of finding the number of 15-letter palindromes that can be formed using the letters in the ARMLLexicon, with the constraint that there are four consecutive letters that spell out \"ARM L\", we can follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the structure of a 15-letter palindrome**:\n   A 15-letter palindrome has the form \\( \\overline{a_1 a_2 \\ldots a_7 a_7 \\ldots a_2 a_1} \\). This means that the first 7 letters determine the entire sequence.\n\n2. **Determine the positions for \"ARM L\"**:\n   We need to place the sequence \"ARM L\" such that it forms four consecutive letters in the 15-letter palindrome. Since \"ARM L\" is 4 letters long, it can start at positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 in the first half of the palindrome (positions 1 to 7).\n\n3. **Count the number of valid positions for \"ARM L\"**:\n   - If \"ARM L\" starts at position 1, it spans from positions 1 to 4.\n   - If \"ARM L\" starts at position 2, it spans from positions 2 to 5.\n   - If \"ARM L\" starts at position 3, it spans from positions 3 to 6.\n   - If \"ARM L\" starts at position 4, it spans from positions 4 to 7.\n\n   Thus, there are 4 valid positions for \"ARM L\" in the first half of the palindrome.\n\n4. **Determine the remaining letters**:\n   After placing \"ARM L\", we have 11 positions left to fill in the first half of the palindrome. The remaining 10 letters in the ARMLLexicon can be used to fill these 11 positions.\n\n5. **Calculate the number of ways to fill the remaining positions**:\n   - We have 10 letters to choose from for the remaining 11 positions.\n   - The first position in the remaining sequence can be any of the 10 letters.\n   - The second position can also be any of the 10 letters, and so on.\n\n   Therefore, the number of ways to fill the remaining 11 positions is \\( 10^{11} \\).\n\n6. **Combine the results**:\n   Since there are 4 valid positions for \"ARM L\" and for each position, there are \\( 10^{11} \\) ways to fill the remaining positions, the total number of 15-letter palindromes is:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 10^{11}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4 \\times 10^{11}}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

An element in a sequence of consecutive integers is cromulent if it is relatively prime to all other numbers in the sequence.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We need to find the maximum and minimum number of cromulent elements in a sequence of 7 consecutive integers.\n   - A number \\( a \\) is relatively prime to another number \\( b \\) if \\(\\gcd(a, b) = 1\\).\n\n2. **Maximum Number of Cromulent Elements:**\n   - The maximum number of cromulent elements occurs when no element in the sequence is relatively prime to any other element.\n   - This happens when all elements in the sequence share a common factor greater than 1.\n   - For 7 consecutive integers, the only way this can happen is if all 7 are multiples of the same prime number.\n   - The smallest set of 7 consecutive integers that are all multiples of the same prime is \\( 7k, 7(k+1), 7(k+2), 7(k+3), 7(k+4), 7(k+5), 7(k+6) \\).\n   - Therefore, the maximum number of cromulent elements is 0.\n\n3. **Minimum Number of Cromulent Elements:**\n   - The minimum number of cromulent elements occurs when at least one element is relatively prime to all other elements.\n   - This happens when the sequence contains at least one prime number.\n   - For 7 consecutive integers, we need to check if there is at least one prime number within this range.\n   - The sequence \\( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 \\) contains the prime number 7.\n   - Therefore, the minimum number of cromulent elements is 1.\n\n### Conclusion\n\n- The maximum number of cromulent elements in a sequence of 7 consecutive integers is 0.\n- The minimum number of cromulent elements in a sequence of 7 consecutive integers is 1.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0 \\text{ and } 1}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

Specifically, we need to choose 3 digits from the set {1, 2, ..., 9} with repetition allowed, but the order matters.\n\n   The number of ways to choose the first three digits is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\binom{9-1+3}{3} = \\binom{11}{3}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Choosing the Last Three Digits:**\n   - The fourth digit of the six-digit number can be any digit from 0 to 9.\n   - The fifth digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, but it must be less than the fourth digit.\n   - The sixth digit can be any digit from 0 to 9, but it must be less than the fifth digit.\n\n   Similarly, the number of ways to choose the last three digits is given by:\n   \\[\n   \\sum_{k=1}^{3} \\binom{10-1+3}{3} = \\binom{12}{3}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combining the Choices:**\n   - Since the choices of the first three digits and the last three digits are independent, we multiply the number of ways to choose the first three digits by the number of ways to choose the last three digits.\n\n   Therefore, the total number of sort-of-decreasing six-digit numbers is:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{11}{3} \\times \\binom{12}{3}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculating the Final Result:**\n   - We need to compute the values of the binomial coefficients:\n     \\[\n     \\binom{11}{3} = \\frac{11 \\times 10 \\times 9}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 165\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\binom{12}{3} = \\frac{12 \\times 11 \\times 10}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 220\n     \\]\n\n   - Multiplying these values together gives:\n     \\[\n     165 \\times 220 = 36300\n     \\]\n\nThus, the number of sort-of-decreasing six-digit natural numbers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{36300}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

We know:\n\\[ BP \\cdot PE = 12 \\cdot 4 = 48 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Angle Bisector Theorem\nThe Angle Bisector Theorem states that the ratio of the segments created by the angle bisector on the opposite side is equal to the ratio of the other two sides of the triangle. Therefore:\n\\[ \\frac{AD}{DC} = \\frac{AB}{BC} \\]\n\n### Step 4: Set Up the Ratio\nWe need to find \\(\\frac{AC}{AE}\\). Let \\(AC = m\\) and \\(AE = n\\). We know:\n\\[ \\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{AC}{AE} \\]\n\n### Step 5: Use the Power of a Point Theorem\nFrom the Power of a Point theorem:\n\\[ AP \\cdot PE = 48 \\]\nSince \\(AP = x\\) and \\(PE = 4\\), we have:\n\\[ x \\cdot 4 = 48 \\]\n\\[ x = 12 \\]\n\n### Step 6: Relate \\(AP\\) to \\(AC\\)\nSince \\(AP = 12\\) and \\(AC = m\\), we have:\n\\[ m = 12 + n \\]\n\n### Step 7: Solve for the Ratio\nWe need to find \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\):\n\\[ \\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{12 + n}{n} = 1 + \\frac{12}{n} \\]\n\n### Step 8: Use the Given Information\nWe know \\(BP = 12\\) and \\(PE = 4\\). Since \\(P\\) is on the angle bisector, we can use the fact that the ratio of the segments on the angle bisector is equal to the ratio of the sides:\n\\[ \\frac{BP}{PE} = \\frac{12}{4} = 3 \\]\n\n### Step 9: Final Calculation\nSince \\(BP = 12\\) and \\(PE = 4\\), we have:\n\\[ \\frac{BP}{PE} = 3 \\]\nThis implies:\n\\[ \\frac{AP}{PE} = 3 \\]\n\\[ \\frac{12}{4} = 3 \\]\n\nThus, the ratio \\(\\frac{AC}{AE}\\) is:\n\\[ \\frac{AC}{AE} = 3 \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{3}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

For a number \\(n\\) with prime factorization \\(n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \\cdots p_k^{e_k}\\), the sum of divisors function can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\n\\sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \\cdots + p_1^{e_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \\cdots + p_2^{e_2}) \\cdots (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \\cdots + p_k^{e_k})\n\\]\nThis formula arises from the geometric series sum for each prime factor.\n\nA common pitfall in problems involving the sum of divisors is overlooking the contribution of each prime factor and its powers. It is crucial to consider all possible divisors, including those that are products of different prime factors.\n\nAn important theoretical insight is that the sum of divisors function is multiplicative, meaning that if \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, then \\(\\sigma(mn) = \\sigma(m) \\sigma(n)\\). This property can simplify calculations when dealing with numbers that have a known factorization.\n<\/knowledge_base_end>\n<solution_start>\nTo solve the problem, we need to find an integer \\( n \\) such that \\( 2009 < n < 3009 \\) and the sum of the odd positive divisors of \\( n \\) is 1024.\n\nFirst, let's understand the condition that the sum of the odd positive divisors of \\( n \\) is 1024. The sum of the divisors function, \\(\\sigma(n)\\), can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\sigma(n) = \\sigma(n_{\\text{odd}}) \\cdot \\sigma(n_{\\text{even}})\n\\]\nwhere \\( n_{\\text{odd}} \\) is the product of the odd prime factors of \\( n \\) and \\( n_{\\text{even}} \\) is the product of the even prime factors of \\( n \\).\n\nGiven that the sum of the odd divisors is 1024, we have:\n\\[\n\\sigma(n_{\\text{odd}}) = 1024\n\\]\n\nSince 1024 is a power of 2, it suggests that \\( n_{\\text{odd}} \\) must be a product of primes that, when summed, equals 1024. The only way to achieve this is if \\( n_{\\text{odd}} \\) is a power of 2, because the sum of divisors of any other form would not yield 1024.\n\nThus, \\( n_{\\text{odd}} \\) must be a power of 2. Let's denote \\( n_{\\text{odd}} = 2^k \\). Then:\n\\[\n\\sigma(2^k) = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^k = 2^{k+1} - 1\n\\]\nWe need:\n\\[\n2^{k+1} - 1 = 1024\n\\]\nSolving for \\( k \\):\n\\[\n2^{k+1} = 1025\n\\]\n\\[\nk+1 = \\log_2(1025)\n\\]\n\\[\nk+1 \\approx 10\n\\]\n\\[\nk = 9\n\\]\nThus, \\( n_{\\text{odd}} = 2^9 = 512 \\).\n\nNow, we need to find \\( n \\) such that \\( 2009 < n < 3009 \\) and \\( n \\) is a multiple of 512. The multiples of 512 within this range are:\n\\[\n512 \\times 4 = 2048\n\\]\n\\[\n512 \\times 5 = 2560\n\\]\n\\[\n512 \\times 6 = 3072 \\quad (\\text{out of range})\n\\]\n\nSo, the only possible value for \\( n \\) is 2048. We need to verify that the sum of the odd divisors of 2048 is indeed 1024.\n\nThe prime factorization of 2048 is:\n\\[\n2048 = 2^{11}\n\\]\nThe sum of the divisors of \\( 2^{11} \\) is:\n\\[\n\\sigma(2^{11}) = 1 + 2 + 2^2 + \\cdots + 2^{11} = 2^{12} - 1 = 4096 - 1 = 4095\n\\]\n\nHowever, we need the sum of the odd divisors to be 1024. This suggests that 2048 is not the correct value. We need to re-evaluate our approach.\n\nLet's consider the correct approach:\n\\[\n\\sigma(n_{\\text{odd}}) = 1024\n\\]\nThe only way to achieve this is if \\( n_{\\text{odd}} = 2^9 = 512 \\).\n\nThus, \\( n \\) must be a multiple of 512. The only multiple of 512 within the range 2009 to 3009 is 2048.\n\nTherefore, the correct value of \\( n \\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2048}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

The taxicab distance to a vertex \\((a, b, c)\\) is:\n   \\[\n   d\\left((x, y, z), (a, b, c)\\right) = |x - a| + |y - b| + |z - c|\n   \\]\n\n3. **Identify the points to be removed:**\n   We need to remove points where the taxicab distance to any vertex is less than \\(\\frac{3}{5}\\).

{"question":"A fair coin is flipped $n$ times. Compute the smallest positive integer $n$ for which the probability that the coin has the same result every time is less than $10 \\%$.","category":"math","gt":["5"],"answer":"<knowledge_base_start>\nIn probability theory, the probability of an event is a measure of the likelihood that the event will occur. It is typically expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty. For a fair coin, the probability of landing heads (H) or tails (T) on a single flip is 0.5 each.\n\nThe probability of a sequence of independent events, such as multiple coin flips, can be calculated by multiplying the probabilities of each individual event. For example, the probability of getting heads on all three flips of a fair coin is \\(0.5 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.5 = 0.125\\).\n\nA common pitfall in probability problems is assuming that the events are not independent, which can lead to incorrect calculations. In the case of coin flips, each flip is independent of the others, meaning the outcome of one flip does not affect the outcome of another.\n\nAnother important concept is the complement rule, which states that the probability of an event not occurring is 1 minus the probability of the event occurring. This can be useful for simplifying calculations, especially when dealing with the probability of at least one event occurring.\n\nIn the context of this problem, understanding the probability of a specific sequence (e.g., all heads or all tails) and applying the complement rule to find the probability of at least one other sequence (e.g., not all heads or not all tails) is crucial.\n<\/knowledge_base_end>\n<solution_start>\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \\( n \\) such that the probability of getting the same result (either all heads or all tails) in \\( n \\) coin flips is less than 10%.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Define the Probability of All Heads or All Tails:**\n   The probability of getting all heads in \\( n \\) flips is \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n \\). Similarly, the probability of getting all tails is also \\( \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n \\).\n\n2. **Total Probability of All Heads or All Tails:**\n   Since these two events are mutually exclusive, the total probability of getting either all heads or all tails is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^n = 2^{1-n}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set Up the Inequality:**\n   We need this probability to be less than 10%, or 0.1:\n   \\[\n   2^{1-n} < 0.1\n   \\]\n\n4. **Solve the Inequality:**\n   To solve for \\( n \\), we take the logarithm (base 2) of both sides:\n   \\[\n   1 - n < \\log_2(0.1)\n   \\]\n\n5. **Calculate \\( \\log_2(0.1) \\):**\n   Using the change of base formula for logarithms:\n   \\[\n   \\log_2(0.1) = \\frac{\\log_{10}(0.1)}{\\log_{10}(2)}\n   \\]\n   We know that \\( \\log_{10}(0.1) = -1 \\) and \\( \\log_{10}(2) \\approx 0.3010 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\log_2(0.1) = \\frac{-1}{0.3010} \\approx -3.3219\n   \\]\n\n6. **Substitute and Solve for \\( n \\):**\n   \\[\n   1 - n < -3.3219\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n > 1 + 3.3219\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   n > 4.3219\n   \\]\n\n7. **Determine the Smallest Integer \\( n \\):**\n   Since \\( n \\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:\n   \\[\n   n = 5\n   \\]\n\n### Final Answer\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

Therefore, the total number of possible colorings is:\n   \\[\n   2^6 = 64\n   \\]\n\n2. **Counting Favorable Colorings**:\n   We need to count the number of colorings where no three faces of the same color share a common vertex.

Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[\n\\lfloor 20 - a \\rfloor = k, \\quad \\lfloor 19 - b \\rfloor = k, \\quad \\lfloor a b \\rfloor = k\n\\]\n\n### Step 1: Analyze \\(\\lfloor 20 - a \\rfloor = k\\)\n\nFrom \\(\\lfloor 20 - a \\rfloor = k\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nk \\leq 20 - a < k + 1\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[\n20 - k - 1 < a \\leq 20 - k\n\\]\n\nor equivalently:\n\n\\[\n20 - k - 1 < a \\leq 20 - k\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Analyze \\(\\lfloor 19 - b \\rfloor = k\\)\n\nFrom \\(\\lfloor 19 - b \\rfloor = k\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nk \\leq 19 - b < k + 1\n\\]\n\nThis implies:\n\n\\[\n19 - k - 1 < b \\leq 19 - k\n\\]\n\nor equivalently:\n\n\\[\n19 - k - 1 < b \\leq 19 - k\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Analyze \\(\\lfloor a b \\rfloor = k\\)\n\nFrom \\(\\lfloor a b \\rfloor = k\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nk \\leq a b < k + 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Combine the inequalities\n\nWe need to find the range of \\(a + b\\). From the inequalities derived:\n\n1. \\(20 - k - 1 < a \\leq 20 - k\\)\n2. \\(19 - k - 1 < b \\leq 19 - k\\)\n\nThe sum \\(a + b\\) will be maximized when \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are at their maximum values within their respective ranges. Therefore:\n\n\\[\na \\leq 20 - k \\quad \\text{and} \\quad b \\leq 19 - k\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum value of \\(a + b\\) is:\n\n\\[\na + b \\leq (20 - k) + (19 - k) = 39 - 2k\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Determine the least upper bound\n\nTo find the least upper bound of \\(a + b\\), we need to consider the smallest possible value of \\(k\\). Since \\(k\\) is an integer and \\(\\lfloor a b \\rfloor = k\\), \\(k\\) must be a non-negative integer. The smallest possible value of \\(k\\) is 0.\n\nIf \\(k = 0\\):\n\n\\[\na + b \\leq 39 - 2 \\cdot 0 = 39\n\\]\n\nWe need to check if \\(k = 0\\) is feasible. If \\(k = 0\\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\lfloor 20 - a \\rfloor = 0 \\implies 0 \\leq 20 - a < 1 \\implies 19 < a \\leq 20\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\lfloor 19 - b \\rfloor = 0 \\implies 0 \\leq 19 - b < 1 \\implies 18 < b \\leq 19\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\lfloor a b \\rfloor = 0 \\implies 0 \\leq a b < 1\n\\]\n\nFor \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to satisfy these conditions, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be very close to 20 and 19, respectively. However, the product \\(a b\\) will be very close to 1, not 0. Therefore, \\(k = 0\\) is not feasible.\n\nThe next smallest possible value of \\(k\\) is 1. If \\(k = 1\\):\n\n\\[\na + b \\leq 39 - 2 \\cdot 1 = 37\n\\]\n\nWe need to check if \\(k = 1\\) is feasible. If \\(k = 1\\), then:\n\n\\[\n\\lfloor 20 - a \\rfloor = 1 \\implies 1 \\leq 20 - a < 2 \\implies 18 < a \\leq 19\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\lfloor 19 - b \\rfloor = 1 \\implies 1 \\leq 19 - b < 2 \\implies 17 < b \\leq 18\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\lfloor a b \\rfloor = 1 \\implies 1 \\leq a b < 2\n\\]\n\nFor \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) to satisfy these conditions, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be very close to 19 and 18, respectively. The product \\(a b\\) will be very close to 1, ensuring that \\(\\lfloor a b \\rfloor = 1\\).\n\nThus, the least upper bound of the set of possible values of \\(a + b\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{37}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

If we can partition the 9 switches into two sets such that each set has exactly 4 switches and each switch in one set is connected to all switches in the other set, then we can ensure that each set's switches are toggled in such a way that they all end up on.\n\n4. **Partitioning the Switches:**\n   - We need to partition the 9 switches into two sets of 4 switches each.\n   - The number of ways to choose 4 switches out of 9 is given by the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{9}{4} \\).\n\n5. **Calculating the Binomial Coefficient:**\n   \\[\n   \\binom{9}{4} = \\frac{9!}{4!(9-4)!} = \\frac{9!}{4!5!} = \\frac{9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 126\n   \\]\n\n6. **Ensuring All Switches Turn On:**\n   - For each partition, we need to ensure that the 4 switches in one set are toggled in such a way that they all end up on, and the 4 switches in the other set are toggled in the opposite manner.\n   - This can be achieved by ensuring that the number of flips of switches in each set is odd.\n\n7. **Minimum Number of Minutes:**\n   -

Therefore, we can rewrite the equations as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log_4 x + \\frac{3}{2} \\log_4 (yz) = 2 \\\\\n& \\log_4 y + \\frac{3}{2} \\log_4 (xz) = 4 \\\\\n& \\log_4 z + \\frac{3}{2} \\log_4 (xy) = 5.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nNext, we introduce new variables to simplify the equations. Let:\n\\[\na = \\log_4 x, \\quad b = \\log_4 y, \\quad c = \\log_4 z.\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the equations, we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a + \\frac{3}{2} (\\log_4 y + \\log_4 z) = 2 \\\\\n& b + \\frac{3}{2} (\\log_4 x + \\log_4 z) = 4 \\\\\n& c + \\frac{3}{2} (\\log_4 x + \\log_4 y) = 5.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can combine the terms:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a + \\frac{3}{2} (b + c) = 2 \\\\\n& b + \\frac{3}{2} (a + c) = 4 \\\\\n& c + \\frac{3}{2} (a + b) = 5.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nTo solve this system, we will use the method of elimination. First, let's isolate \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) in each equation:\n\n1. From the first equation:\n\\[\na + \\frac{3}{2} b + \\frac{3}{2} c = 2 \\implies 2a + 3b + 3c = 4.\n\\]\n\n2. From the second equation:\n\\[\nb + \\frac{3}{2} a + \\frac{3}{2} c = 4 \\implies 2b + 3a + 3c = 8.\n\\]\n\n3. From the third equation:\n\\[\nc + \\frac{3}{2} a + \\frac{3}{2} b = 5 \\implies 2c + 3a + 3b = 10.\n\\]\n\nNow we have the system:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& 2a + 3b + 3c = 4 \\\\\n& 2b + 3a + 3c = 8 \\\\\n& 2c + 3a + 3b = 10.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nWe can subtract the first equation from the second and the second from the third to eliminate \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n\n1. Subtract the first equation from the second:\n\\[\n(2b + 3a + 3c) - (2a + 3b + 3c) = 8 - 4 \\implies a - b = 4.\n\\]\n\n2. Subtract the second equation from the third:\n\\[\n(2c + 3a + 3b) - (2b + 3a + 3c) = 10 - 8 \\implies b - c = 2.\n\\]\n\nNow we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a - b = 4 \\\\\n& b - c = 2.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nWe can solve these two equations to find \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\):\n\nFrom \\(a - b = 4\\), we get \\(a = b + 4\\).\n\nSubstitute \\(a = b + 4\\) into \\(b - c = 2\\):\n\\[\nb - c = 2 \\implies b - c = 2.\n\\]\n\nNow we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a = b + 4 \\\\\n& b = c + 2.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(b = c + 2\\) into \\(a = b + 4\\):\n\\[\na = (c + 2) + 4 = c + 6.\n\\]\n\nNow we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a = c + 6 \\\\\n& b = c + 2.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(a = c + 6\\) and \\(b = c + 2\\) into the first equation:\n\\[\n2(c + 6) + 3(c + 2) + 3c = 4 \\implies 2c + 12 + 3c + 6 + 3c = 4 \\implies 8c + 18 = 4 \\implies 8c = -14 \\implies c = -\\frac{7}{4}.\n\\]\n\nNow we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a = c + 6 = -\\frac{7}{4} + 6 = \\frac{17}{4} \\\\\n& b = c + 2 = -\\frac{7}{4} + 2 = \\frac{1}{4}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log_4 x = \\frac{17}{4} \\implies x = 4^{\\frac{17}{4}} \\\\\n& \\log_4 y = \\frac{1}{4} \\implies y = 4^{\\frac{1}{4}} \\\\\n& \\log_4 z = -\\frac{7}{4} \\implies z = 4^{-\\frac{7}{4}}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find \\(xyz\\):\n\\[\nxyz = 4^{\\frac{17}{4}} \\cdot 4^{\\frac{1}{4}} \\cdot 4^{-\\frac{7}{4}} = 4^{\\frac{17}{4} + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{7}{4}} = 4^{\\frac{11}{4}}.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(4 = 2^2\\), we have:\n\\[\n4^{\\frac{11}{4}} = (2^2)^{\\frac{11}{4}} = 2^{\\frac{22}{4}} = 2^{5.5} = 2^{5.5}.\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(k = 5.5\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{5.5}.\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

Key to solving such problems is understanding the factorization of numbers and the properties of integers. For instance, the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states that every integer greater than 1 is either a prime number or can be uniquely expressed as a product of prime numbers. This theorem is crucial when dealing with products of integers, as it helps in identifying possible combinations of factors.\n\nWhen dealing with systems of equations where the variables are integers, it's important to consider the divisibility and common factors among the equations. This can lead to insights about the possible values of the variables. For example, if \\(a b c = 12,000\\) and \\(b c d = 24,000\\), one can infer that \\(d\\) must be a factor of 24,000 that, when combined with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), satisfies both equations.\n\nCommon pitfalls include overlooking the integer constraints, which can lead to solutions that are not feasible. Misunderstanding the relationship between the variables in the equations can also lead to incorrect solutions. It's essential to systematically analyze each equation and how they interact with each other to find all possible integer solutions.\n\nAdditional theoretical insights involve understanding the concept of coprimeness and how it can simplify the system of equations. If certain variables are coprime, their product can be more easily factored, leading to a clearer path to the solution.\n<\/knowledge_base_end>\n<solution_start>\nTo solve the system of equations for the ordered quadruples of integers \\((a, b, c, d)\\), we start with the given equations:\n\n\\[\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\na b c = 12,000 \\\\\nb c d = 24,000 \\\\\nc d a = 36,000\n\\end{array}\\right.\n\\]\n\nFirst, we divide the second equation by the first equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{b c d}{a b c} = \\frac{24,000}{12,000}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{a} = 2 \\implies d = 2a\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide the third equation by the first equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{c d a}{a b c} = \\frac{36,000}{12,000}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{b} = 3 \\implies d = 3b\n\\]\n\nWe now have two expressions for \\(d\\):\n\n\\[\nd = 2a \\quad \\text{and} \\quad d = 3b\n\\]\n\nEquating these two expressions, we get:\n\n\\[\n2a = 3b \\implies a = \\frac{3}{2}b\n\\]\n\nSince \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) must be integers, \\(b\\) must be a multiple of 2. Let \\(b = 2k\\) for some integer \\(k\\). Then:\n\n\\[\na = \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot 2k = 3k\n\\]\n\nNow, we substitute \\(a = 3k\\) and \\(b = 2k\\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[\na b c = 12,000 \\implies (3k)(2k)c = 12,000 \\implies 6k^2 c = 12,000 \\implies c = \\frac{12,000}{6k^2} = \\frac{2,000}{k^2}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(c\\) must be an integer, \\(k^2\\) must be a divisor of 2,000. The divisors of 2,000 are \\(1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000\\). Therefore, \\(k\\) can be any integer such that \\(k^2\\) is one of these divisors.\n\nFor each valid \\(k\\), we have:\n\n\\[\na = 3k, \\quad b = 2k, \\quad c = \\frac{2,000}{k^2}, \\quad d = 2a = 6k\n\\]\n\nWe need to count the number of valid \\(k\\) values. The valid \\(k\\) values are the divisors of 2,000 that are perfect squares. The perfect square divisors of 2,000 are \\(1, 4, 25, 100, 2,500\\).\n\nThus, there are 5 possible values for \\(k\\), and for each \\(k\\), there is a corresponding valid quadruple \\((a, b, c, d)\\).\n\nTherefore, the number of ordered quadruples \\((a, b, c, d)\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

We need to find the largest possible difference \\(d\\) such that the 15 terms of the AP fit within the range 0 to 999.\n\n3. **Determine the Largest Possible Difference**:\n   - The first term \\(a\\) of the AP can be 0 (the smallest possible value).\n   - The last term \\(l\\) of the AP can be 999 (the largest possible value).\n   - The formula for the \\(n\\)-th term of an AP is \\(a_n = a + (n-1)d\\).\n   - For \\(n = 15\\), the last term \\(l = 999\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(999 = 0 + 14d\\), which simplifies to \\(d = \\frac{999}{14} \\approx 71.357\\).\n\n4. **Adjust the Difference to Fit the Range**:\n   - Since \\(d\\) must be an integer, we take the largest integer less than or equal to 71.357, which is 71.\n\n5. **Verify the Terms Fit Within the Range**:\n   - With \\(d = 71\\), the 15 terms of the AP are: \\(0, 71, 142, 213, 284, 355, 426, 497, 568, 639, 710, 781, 852, 923, 994\\).\n   - All these terms are within the range 0 to 999.\n\n6. **Calculate the Sum of the AP**:\n   - The sum \\(S_n\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an AP is given by \\(S_n = \\frac{n}{2} (a + l)\\).\n   - Here, \\(n = 15\\), \\(a = 0\\), and \\(l = 999\\).\n   - Therefore, \\(S_{15} = \\frac{15}{2} (0 + 999) = \\frac{15}{2} \\times 999 = 15 \\times 499.5 = 7492.5\\).\n\nSince the sum must be an integer, we round down to the nearest integer, which is 7492.\n\nThus, the largest possible sum of the 15 answers is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7492}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

Since there are two sets, the total number of ways to order the cards within the sets is \\((100!)^2\\).\n\n### Step 6: Dividing by the Order Within Each Set\nTo find the number of distinct rules, we divide the total number of permutations by the number of permutations within each set:\n\\[\n\\frac{200!}{(100!)^2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Calculating the Final Result\nWe need to compute the value of:\n\\[\n\\frac{200!}{(100!)^2}\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Simplifying the Expression\nWe can simplify the expression by recognizing that:\n\\[\n\\frac{200!}{(100!)^2} = \\frac{200 \\times 199 \\times 198 \\times \\cdots \\times 101}{100 \\times 99 \\times 98 \\times \\cdots \\times 1}\n\\]\n\nThis is the number of ways to choose 100 positions out of 200 for the first set, with the remaining 100 positions automatically forming the second set.\n\n### Step 9: Using Binomial Coefficient\nThe number of ways to choose 100 positions out of 200 is given by the binomial coefficient:\n\\[\n\\binom{200}{100}\n\\]\n\n### Step 10: Final Calculation\nThe binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{200}{100}\\) is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\binom{200}{100} = \\frac{200!}{100! \\times 100!}\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of ways to define the rule is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\binom{200}{100}}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}
