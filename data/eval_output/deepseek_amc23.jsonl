What is $f(2023)$?","gt":96,"answer":"<knowledge_base_start>\n**Key Definitions and Explanations:**\n- **Divisor Function:** The divisor function, denoted by \\( \\sigma_x(n) \\), is a function that represents the sum of the \\( x \\)-th powers of the divisors of \\( n \\). For \\( x = 0 \\), \\( \\sigma_0(n) \\) counts the number of divisors of \\( n \\).\n- **Functional Equation:** A functional equation is an equation where the unknown is a function, rather than a number or a set. Solving a functional equation involves finding the function or functions that satisfy the given equation for all admissible inputs.\n\n**General Relevant Formulas and Equations:**\n- The divisor function can be expressed as:\n  \\[\n  \\sigma_x(n) = \\sum_{d|n} d^x\n  \\]\n- For \\( x = 0 \\), the divisor function simplifies to:\n  \\[\n  \\sigma_0(n) = \\sum_{d|n} 1 = \\tau(n)\n  \\]\n  where \\( \\tau(n) \\) is the number of divisors of \\( n \\).\n\n**Common Pitfalls and Misconceptions:**\n- A common misconception is that the divisor function only applies to positive integers. However, it can be extended to other number systems, such as the complex numbers.\n- Another pitfall is assuming that the function \\( f \\) must be multiplicative without verifying this property.\n\n**Additional Theoretical Insights:**\n- The divisor function is multiplicative, meaning that if \\( m \\) and \\( n \\) are coprime, then:\n  \\[\n  \\sigma_x(mn) = \\sigma_x(m) \\sigma_x(n)\n  \\]\n- Functional equations often require the use of generating functions or other techniques to find the solution.\n<\/knowledge_base_end>\n<solution_start>\nTo solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given functional equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{d \\mid n} d \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right) = 1\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the function \\( f \\) that satisfies this equation for all positive integers \\( n \\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Initial Analysis:**\n   - Let \\( n = 1 \\). The equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{d \\mid 1} d \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{1}{d}\\right) = 1\n     \\]\n     Since \\( 1 \\mid 1 \\), we have:\n     \\[\n     1 \\cdot f(1) = 1 \\implies f(1) = 1\n     \\]\n\n2. **Using the Functional Equation:**\n   - Let \\( n = p \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime number. The equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{d \\mid p} d \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{p}{d}\\right) = 1\n     \\]\n     Since \\( p \\) is prime, the only divisor is \\( 1 \\):\n     \\[\n     1 \\cdot f(p) = 1 \\implies f(p) = 1\n     \\]\n\n3. **Using the Functional Equation for Powers of Primes:**\n   - Let \\( n = p^k \\), where \\( p \\) is a prime and \\( k \\) is a positive integer. The equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{d \\mid p^k} d \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{p^k}{d}\\right) = 1\n     \\]\n     The divisors of \\( p^k \\) are \\( 1, p, p^2, \\ldots, p^k \\). Therefore:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{i=0}^{k} p^i \\cdot f\\left(p^{k-i}\\right) = 1\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solving for \\( f(p^k) \\):**\n   - We need to find \\( f(p^k) \\) in terms of \\( f(p^{k-1}), f(p^{k-2}), \\ldots, f(1) \\).\n   - From the equation:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{i=0}^{k} p^i \\cdot f\\left(p^{k-i}\\right) = 1\n     \\]\n   - We know \\( f(1) = 1 \\).\n\n5. **Generalizing for Composite Numbers:**\n   - Let \\( n = ab \\), where \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime. The equation becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{d \\mid ab} d \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{ab}{d}\\right) = 1\n     \\]\n     Since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are coprime, the divisors of \\( ab \\) are of the form \\( d_1d_2 \\) where \\( d_1 \\mid a \\) and \\( d_2 \\mid b \\). Therefore:\n     \\[\n     \\sum_{d_1 \\mid a} \\sum_{d_2 \\mid b} (d_1d_2) \\cdot f\\left(\\frac{ab}{d_1d_2}\\right) = 1\n     \\]\n\n6. **Using the Functional Equation for \\( f(2023) \\):**\n   - We need to find \\( f(2023) \\).\n   - Since \\( 2023 = 17 \\times 119 \\), we use the coprimality property:\n     \\[\n     f(2023) = f(17 \\times 119)\n     \\]\n   - We need to express \\( f(2023) \\) in terms of \\( f(17) \\) and \\( f(119) \\).\n\n### Final Calculation\n\nGiven the initial conditions and the functional equation, we can deduce that \\( f(n) = 1 \\) for all \\( n \\). This is because the equation forces \\( f(n) \\) to be consistent with the values of \\( f \\) for smaller divisors, which in turn are consistent with each other.\n\nThus, the value of \\( f(2023) \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]\n<\/solution_end>"}

Carlos also knew that he had to pay a $7.5\\%$ sales tax on the discounted price. He had $$43$ dollars. What is the original (before discount) price of the most expensive shoes he could afford to buy? ","gt":50,"answer":"<knowledge_base_start>\nKey definitions and explanations:\n- **Percentage**: A way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100. It is often denoted using the percent sign, \"%\". For example, 20% means 20 out of 100.\n- **Discount**: A reduction in the usual price of a good or service. It is often expressed as a percentage of the original price.\n- **Sales tax**: A tax levied on the sale of goods and services, usually calculated as a percentage of the purchase price.\n\nGeneral relevant formulas and equations:\n- **Discounted Price**: Original Price - (Original Price * Discount Percentage)\n- **Taxed Price**: Discounted Price + (Discounted Price * Sales Tax Percentage)\n\nCommon pitfalls and misconceptions:\n- Confusing the order of operations when calculating the final price after both a discount and a tax.

We can set up the equation to find the original price before the discount.\n\nLet \\( P \\) be the original price of the shoes.\n\nAfter a 20% discount, the price becomes:\n\\[ 0.8P = 43 \\]\n\n### Step 2: Solve for the original price\nTo find \\( P \\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation:\n\\[ P = \\frac{43}{0.8} \\]\n\nPerform the division:\n\\[ P = \\frac{43}{0.8} = 53.75 \\]\n\nSo, the original price of the shoes is $53.75.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the price after the sales tax\nCarlos also has to pay a 7.5% sales tax on the discounted price. We need to find 7.5% of $43 and add it to $43.\n\nFirst, calculate 7.5% of $43:\n\\[ 0.075 \\times 43 = 3.225 \\]\n\nNow, add this amount to $43:\n\\[ 43 + 3.225 = 46.225 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Verify the final price\nWe need to ensure that the final price of $46.225 is within the budget of $43. The calculation seems to be correct, as $46.225 is less than $43.\n\nHowever, let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure there are no errors.\n\n### Re-evaluation\nLet's assume the original price is $50 and see if the final price is within the budget:\n\n1. Calculate the discounted price:\n   \\[ 0.8 \\times 50 = 40 \\]\n\n2. Calculate the sales tax on the discounted price:\n   \\[ 0.075 \\times 40 = 3 \\]\n\n3. Add the sales tax to the discounted price:\n   \\[ 40 + 3 = 43 \\]\n\nThis matches the given budget of $43. Therefore, the original price of $50 is within the budget.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe original price of the most expensive shoes Carlos could afford to buy is:\n\\[ \\boxed{50} \\]\n<\/solution_end>"}
